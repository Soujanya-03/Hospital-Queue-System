How It Works:
The system is built around three core views, each tailored to a specific user:

Patient View: Allows patients to generate a unique token number. They can see their current position, estimated wait time, and status (Waiting, Called, Serving) directly on their device, reducing anxiety.
Admin Dashboard: Gives staff complete control over the queue. With an intuitive interface, they can call the next token, start a service, mark it as complete, and monitor real-time statistics like total patients waiting and completed services.
Public Display Screen: Designed for TVs or monitors in waiting areas, this screen clearly shows the "Now Serving" token number and the next few patients in the queue. It keeps everyone informed and directs patients to the counter at the right time.
